# My Hextris Clone

An addictive puzzle game inspired by **Hextris**, the hexagonal version of Tetris. This project is a **simulation** of the original game, created as a learning experience to understand how such games are built.

## About

This is a clone of the popular **Hextris** game, designed to simulate the mechanics and functionality of the original game. While this project is inspired by **Hextris** and closely follows its core gameplay, it has been built from scratch for learning purposes.

### Purpose:
- To replicate the logic and flow of the **Hextris** game.
- To explore and understand game mechanics like rotation, piece generation, collision detection, and user interaction.
- To improve my skills in JavaScript, HTML5, and game development.
